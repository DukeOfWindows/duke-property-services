            If your deck feels more like a skating rink than a relaxing outdoor space, you're not alone. On the Kapiti Coast — especially in shaded areas like Waikanae and Raumati South — winter creates the perfect storm for moss, mould, and slick grime buildup.

          <h2>Why Deck Cleaning Matters in Winter</h2>
          <p>
            Moisture, falling leaves, and low sunlight mean timber stays wet for longer, encouraging algae growth. Left untreated, this not only becomes a slip hazard but also accelerates wood rot and surface decay.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve seen decks in Otaki Beach and Paraparaumu that went from grey and slimy to clean, grippy, and safe again — all with one winter clean.

          <h2>Our Winter Deck Cleaning Process</h2>
          <p>
            Duke Property Services uses a low-pressure wash paired with biodegradable cleaners to gently lift grime, algae, and dirt without damaging the wood.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>🧼 Pre-treatment to kill algae and loosen buildup</li>
            <li>💧 Gentle rinse to reveal the original timber</li>
            <li>🔒 Optional post-wash seal to help repel future moisture</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We regularly service winter-prone properties in Levin, Pukerua Bay, and even bush-clad decks in Paekākāriki.

          <h2>Don’t Wait Until Spring</h2>
          <p>
            Many homeowners wait until summer to tackle outdoor cleaning — but winter is when decks are most dangerous. Cleaning now makes your home safer and helps your timber last longer.

            Plus, you’ll be ready to enjoy your deck the moment the sun comes back.

          <h2>FAQs</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Is it safe to clean my deck in winter?</strong><br />
            Yes — winter cleaning is not only safe but essential. We use equipment designed for cold, damp conditions across the Kapiti Coast.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Will cleaning damage my timber?</strong><br />
            No. We avoid high pressure and use tailored soft washing techniques that preserve timber on decks in areas like Raumati and Plimmerton.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How often should I clean my deck?</strong><br />
            Once a year is usually enough, but shaded or tree-covered decks (like in Otaihanga or Pukerua Bay) may benefit from a 6–9 month cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Do you do multi-level or hard-to-reach decks?</strong><br />
            Absolutely. We’ve cleaned elevated and wraparound decks all over Kapiti and Horowhenua — even in steep spots like Tawa.
