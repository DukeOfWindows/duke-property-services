          <p>
            When gutters get clogged with leaves, dirt, and debris, water canâ€™t flow freely. This leads to overflow,
            which can seep into your walls, damage your foundation, and create costly repairs. The worst part? Most
            of this damage is preventable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regular gutter cleaning â€” at least twice a year â€” ensures water flows away from your home, not into it. It
            also helps prevent pest infestations, mould growth, and roof rot.

          <h2>How Much Can Clogged Gutters Cost?</h2>
          <p>
            Water damage repairs from neglected gutters can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. For
            example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>ðŸ’§ Foundation repairs: $5,000+</li>
            <li>ðŸ¦  Mould remediation: $2,000â€“$6,000</li>
            <li>ðŸªœ Fascia/soffit repair: $1,000+</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Prevention is Always Cheaper</h2>
          <p>
            A professional gutter clean from Duke Property Services costs far less than emergency repairs. Plus, we use
            ladder safety, downspout flushing, and debris removal to get the job done right.
          </p>
