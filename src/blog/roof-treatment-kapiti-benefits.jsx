          <p>
            On the Kapiti Coast â€” especially in shaded areas like Waikanae or Otaki Gorge â€” moss and lichen thrive on rooftops. Left untreated, they can cause long-term damage and shorten your roofâ€™s life by years.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Roof Treatments Matter</h2>
          <p>
            Moss and algae trap moisture against your roofing material, leading to rot, rust, and lifted shingles or tiles. In wetter parts of Raumati South or Levin, this can escalate quickly â€” turning a minor issue into a major repair bill.
          </p>
          <p>
            A full roof replacement in New Zealand can cost $15,000 or more. A roof treatment? A fraction of the price â€” and it acts like insurance for your most exposed surface.
          </p>

          <h2>How Duke Property Services Treats Roofs</h2>
          <p>
            We apply a gentle, eco-friendly treatment that kills moss and lichen at the roots. Over time, rain naturally washes it away â€” no harsh pressure or scrubbing needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team uses ladder safety systems and treats roofs from Tawa to Te Horo, always prioritising care and compliance.
          </p>

          <h2>What to Expect After Treatment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>âœ… Visible moss begins browning within 2â€“4 weeks</li>
            <li>ðŸŒ§ Natural rainfall removes dead growth over 3â€“6 months</li>
            <li>ðŸ§¼ Roof remains protected for 2â€“3 years</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A single treatment protects your roof through the Kapiti Coastâ€™s changing seasons â€” from summer salt spray in Paraparaumu Beach to winter damp in Pukerua Bay.
          </p>

          <h2>FAQs</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>How often should I treat my roof in Otaki or Waikanae?</strong><br />
            We recommend every 2â€“3 years, or sooner if moss returns. Shaded and damp areas may need more frequent treatment.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Is roof treatment safe for pets and gardens?</strong><br />
            Yes â€” we use environmentally safe products and take care to rinse surrounding areas if needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Do I need to be home during the service?</strong><br />
            Nope! As long as we have access, we can treat your roof while you're out â€” weâ€™ll even text when weâ€™re done.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What types of roofs do you treat?</strong><br />
            We treat all common NZ roof types, including metal, tile, decramastic, and corrugated iron â€” from Newlands to Levin.
          </p>
