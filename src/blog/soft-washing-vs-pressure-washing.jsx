            If you’re a homeowner in areas like Waikanae, Paraparaumu, or even as far south as Johnsonville, you’ve likely seen the buildup of moss, mould, and grime on homes over time. But should you book a pressure wash or a soft wash? The difference matters more than you think.
          </p>

          <h2>Why the Right Washing Method Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Using the wrong method can lead to damaged cladding, water intrusion, or even dislodged paint. For example, blasting a painted weatherboard home in Raumati South with high pressure can strip paint and force moisture into cracks.

            Choosing the correct cleaning technique isn’t just about appearance — it protects your home’s structure and longevity.
          </p>

          <h2>What’s the Difference?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pressure Washing:</strong> Uses high-pressure water to remove stubborn dirt and grime. Ideal for concrete, driveways, and brickwork (think Levin patios or Otaki paths).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Soft Washing:</strong> Combines low pressure with eco-safe detergents to gently remove organic growth like mould, algae, and lichen. Perfect for roofs, cladding, and painted surfaces.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why We Recommend Soft Washing for Most Homes</h2>
          <p>
            Here on the Kapiti Coast, soft washing is ideal for our salt-laden air, moisture-prone environments, and delicate materials. At Duke Property Services, we use biodegradable treatments and gentle rinsing — preserving paint, roofing, and finishes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homeowners in Otaki, Plimmerton, and even hilly suburbs like Pukerua Bay often choose soft washing for roof treatments, house washing, and deck care.
          </p>

          <h2>Protect Now, Save Later</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t risk costly repairs or repainting. Book a <strong>soft wash service with Duke</strong> to safely restore your property’s exterior and extend its life.
          </p>


          <h2>FAQs</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Is soft washing safe for painted homes?</strong><br />
  Yes — soft washing is designed to protect painted surfaces by using low pressure and biodegradable detergents, making it ideal for weatherboard homes from Paraparaumu to Plimmerton.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What surfaces should I avoid pressure washing?</strong><br />
  Avoid using high-pressure water on roofing, cladding, decks, or any painted surface. In places like Raumati Beach, pressure washing can strip paint or force moisture into cracks.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How often should I soft wash my house in Waikanae?</strong><br />
  Most homes on the Kapiti Coast benefit from a soft wash every 12–18 months due to the local humidity, salt air, and organic growth like lichen and algae.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Can I soft wash my roof in Otaki?</strong><br />
  Absolutely. Soft washing is the safest way to clean roofs in Otaki, especially when dealing with moss or lichen. It extends roof life without the harshness of high pressure.
