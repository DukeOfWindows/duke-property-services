            Your driveway is one of the first things people see — and yet it’s often the last thing homeowners clean. On the Kapiti Coast, where damp weather and salt air take their toll, driveways from Porirua to Otaki can quickly turn dark, slippery, and stained.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Driveway Cleaning Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Over time, moss, algae, oil stains, and tyre marks build up — creating both a visual eyesore and a slip risk. This is especially common in shaded spots like Tawa or leafy areas like Waikanae.
          </p>
          <p>
            A clean driveway lifts your entire home’s appearance. Whether you’re selling, hosting guests, or just pulling in after work — it feels good to arrive to clean concrete or pavers.

          <h2>How We Clean Driveways</h2>
          <p>
            At Duke Property Services, we use surface cleaners and controlled pressure washing to safely blast away grime without damaging the surface underneath.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>🧽 We pre-treat stains for better results</li>
            <li>💦 We use rotary surface tools for even, deep cleaning</li>
            <li>🌿 We rinse thoroughly — no mess left behind</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From narrow concrete strips in Raumati to wide driveways in Levin, we’ve cleaned it all — and the difference is always satisfying.

          <h2>Seasonal Tip: Winter & Autumn Build-Up</h2>
          <p>
            Winter moisture and fallen leaves create perfect conditions for moss and slippery build-up. Cleaning your driveway now helps prevent accidents and sets you up for a fresher-looking spring.

          <h2>FAQs</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>How often should I clean my driveway?</strong><br />
            Once a year is ideal, or every 6–9 months in shady or damp areas like Paekākāriki or Otaihanga.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Will pressure washing damage my driveway?</strong><br />
            Not with our methods. We use controlled pressure with the right tools for concrete, pavers, and exposed aggregate.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Can you remove oil stains or rust?</strong><br />
            Yes — we pre-treat those areas to break down stains. While some deep marks may not disappear completely, most customers see a dramatic improvement.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Do you service steep driveways or tight access areas?</strong><br />
            Absolutely. From Pukerua Bay hills to tight Raumati cul-de-sacs, we’re equipped for tricky jobs.
