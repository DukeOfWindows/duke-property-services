            Living on the Kapiti Coast means stunning views — but salty sea air, dust, and pollen can quickly dull your windows. Whether you’re in Raumati Beach, Otaihanga, or Pukerua Bay, clean windows make a massive difference to your home’s feel and value.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Window Cleaning Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Over time, airborne contaminants like salt, pollution, and insect residue can etch into glass, causing permanent marks. This is especially common in homes closer to the coast, like Paraparaumu or Paekākāriki, where sea spray is a daily reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular window cleaning extends the life of your windows and keeps your property looking sharp — whether you're hosting guests or selling your home.

          <h2>Let the Sunshine In</h2>

            Clean windows increase the natural light in your home — brightening rooms and lifting moods. Especially during the darker winter months, regular cleaning helps you get the most from every beam of light.

          <h2>FAQs</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>How often should I clean my windows on the Kapiti Coast?</strong><br />
            For coastal homes in Waikanae or Paraparaumu, we recommend exterior window cleaning every 3–4 months due to the salt and airborne particles.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Do you do interior window cleaning as well?</strong><br />
            Yes — we offer full interior and exterior window cleans throughout the region, from Johnsonville to Levin.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Will rain undo a window clean?</strong><br />
            Not at all. Rain on already dirty windows can worsen streaks, but freshly cleaned windows stay cleaner longer because there’s no grime for rain to cling to.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Do you service two-storey homes?</strong><br />
            Absolutely. We use extendable poles, water-fed systems, and ladder safety for multi-level properties across the Kapiti Coast.
          </p>
