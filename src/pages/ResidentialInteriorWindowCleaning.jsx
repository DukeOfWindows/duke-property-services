    question: "Do I need to move furniture or blinds?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We’ll work around most things, but it helps if you <strong>pull back curtains and move fragile items</strong> off windowsills. If something’s tricky, we’ll give you a hand.
      </>
    ),
  },
{
  question: "What products do you use inside?",
  answer: (
    <>
      For interior window cleaning, we use a classic <strong>squeegee-and-mop system</strong> with a generous squirt of <strong>Dawn® — a gentle, US-made dish soap</strong> that’s safe for kids, pets, and your glass. It’s super effective, and trusted by window pros worldwide.
    </>
  ),
},
  {
    question: "Will there be drips or mess inside?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We carry towels and drop cloths, and we’re pretty tidy operators. <strong>Your floors and furnishings are always protected</strong> — no soggy carpet, pinky promise.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean high interior windows?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Yes — we use extension poles and adjustable squeegees</strong> to reach clerestory or stairwell windows without damaging your walls or flooring.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove marks or stickers on interior glass?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We sure can. <strong>Just let us know ahead of time</strong> so we can bring the right tools for paint spots, decals, or sticky residue. Additional costs may apply. 
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
