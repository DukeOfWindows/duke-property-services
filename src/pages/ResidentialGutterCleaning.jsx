    question: "How often should I get my gutters cleaned?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We recommend <strong>cleaning your gutters at least once a year</strong>.  If you live in a suburban area without overhanging trees, every two years may be enough — but regular maintenance is key. This helps prevent blockages, water damage, and unwanted nesting from birds or pests.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be home for the gutter clean?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Nope!</strong> As long as we have access, we’ll get it done while you carry on with your day. We'll let you know when we're done — and send you photos so you can see the results.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my gutters need cleaning?",
    answer: (
      <>
        If you're seeing <strong>overflowing water, sagging gutters, or plants growing</strong> where they shouldn’t be — it's time to call us. We’re happy to take a look and let you know what’s needed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use ladders or do it from the ground?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Depends on the job! We’re fully equipped with <strong>ladder systems and safety harnesses</strong> for multi-level homes, but often we can clean from the ground using extendable tools.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
