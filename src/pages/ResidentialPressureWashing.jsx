    question: "What surfaces can you pressure wash?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We commonly pressure wash <strong>driveways, concrete paths, patios, fences, and retaining walls</strong>. If it’s grubby and hard, we can probably blast it clean!
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will it damage my concrete or pavers?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Not with us. We use the right PSI and <strong>surface-specific nozzles</strong> to avoid etching or scarring. Old or soft concrete? We'll assess first and adjust our method if needed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What about oil stains or rust marks?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Pressure washing helps, but for heavy stains we often <strong>pre-treat with specialised products</strong>. We’ll let you know what to expect after a quick look.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do you bring your own water?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We usually <strong>hook up to your outdoor tap</strong> — but we can discuss water cartage if needed. Our equipment is high-efficiency so we don’t use more than necessary.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will it make a mess?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Some splashback is normal, but we always do a tidy-up after. We’ll <strong>rinse surrounding areas and paths</strong> so it looks better than when we arrived.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
  ),
