    question: "What commercial surfaces can you pressure wash?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We clean <strong>concrete carparks, loading bays, signage, walls, fences, bin areas, paving, and more</strong>. If it’s exterior and grimy, we can bring it back to life.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can you clean outside business hours?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Absolutely. We can <strong>clean after hours, on weekends, or during public holidays</strong> to avoid disrupting your staff or customers. Let us know what suits.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer one-off cleans or ongoing maintenance?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Both. We can do a one-off clean before inspections, events, or rebranding — or <strong>set you up with a recurring schedule</strong> to keep things tidy long term.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Are your methods safe for painted or delicate surfaces?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Yes — we use adjustable pressure and surface-specific nozzles</strong>. For painted render, signage, or older surfaces, we dial it back and use a soft wash method if needed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Are your team trained and insured?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>100%</strong>. Our crew is trained in commercial site safety, insured for peace of mind, and familiar with working in high-traffic or shared spaces.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      <strong>Payment is due upon completion</strong> unless other arrangements have been made in advance. We offer flexible payment options for commercial clients where needed.
    </>
