    question: "What types of commercial properties do you service?",

        We handle gutter cleaning for <strong>retail buildings, offices, warehouses, apartment blocks, schools, and more</strong>. Multi-unit? No problem — we’re set up for it.
      </>
    ),

  {
    question: "Can you clean multi-storey buildings?",
    answer: (
      <>

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer roof and gutter reports?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. On request, we can provide <strong>before/after photos and a basic condition report</strong> for your records — handy for insurance, tenants, or maintenance plans.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will you dispose of the gutter waste?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Always.</strong> We bag and remove debris from site unless you have compost or green waste bins you’d prefer us to use.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer scheduled maintenance plans?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yep — we can <strong>set you up with 6-monthly or annual gutter cleans</strong> so your buildings stay protected year-round. We’ll even send reminders.
      </>
    ),
  },
    {
    question: "Are your team trained and insured?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>100%</strong>. Our crew is trained in commercial site safety, insured for peace of mind, and familiar with working in high-traffic or shared spaces.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      <strong>Payment is due upon completion</strong> unless other arrangements have been made in advance. We offer flexible payment options for commercial clients where needed.
