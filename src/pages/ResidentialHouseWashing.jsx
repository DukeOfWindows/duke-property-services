    question: "How often should I get my house washed?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We recommend <strong>washing your house once a year</strong> to prevent grime, mould, and lichen from building up — especially on the shaded or south-facing sides.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will house washing damage my paint or cladding?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Not with us. We use a <strong>low-pressure soft wash system</strong> that's safe on all exterior surfaces — including weatherboard, cedar, brick, and painted finishes.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to do anything to prepare?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Just <strong>close your windows, keep pets inside, and move any fragile outdoor items</strong>. We’ll take care of the rest.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the difference between soft washing and water blasting?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Great question. <strong>Soft washing uses gentle pressure and solutions</strong> to clean surfaces without stripping paint or damaging cladding. Water blasting is harsher — better suited for concrete and driveways.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Does house washing remove spider webs and mould?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Yes — that’s the point!</strong> Our wash lifts off dirt, green algae, black mould, and cobwebs to leave your home looking fresh and well-maintained.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
  ),
