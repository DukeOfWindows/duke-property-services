    question: "What types of driveways do you clean?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We clean <strong>concrete, asphalt, exposed aggregate, cobblestone, and paved driveways</strong>. Each one gets a surface-appropriate clean — no one-size-fits-all pressure blasting here.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove oil stains or tyre marks?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Mostly, yes!</strong> We pre-treat tough spots like oil, rust, or tyre scuffs with specialty products. Some deep-set stains may not disappear completely, but we’ll get it looking 100× better.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will the water affect my lawn or garden?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We direct runoff away from your plants whenever possible. Our detergents are <strong>biodegradable and used sparingly</strong> — and we’ll do a post-wash rinse if needed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be home for the job?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Nope — as long as the driveway is clear of cars</strong> and we’ve got hose access, you can carry on with your day. We’ll let you know when it’s done!
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will it stay clean, or do I need to do this often?",
    answer: (
      <>
        That depends on traffic and weather, but <strong>most homes only need it once a year</strong>. If you’re under trees or have frequent oil leaks, more often may be worthwhile.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
  ),
