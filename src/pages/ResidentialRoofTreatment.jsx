    question: "What does a roof treatment actually do?",
    answer: (
      <>
        It kills off <strong>moss, mould, lichen, and algae</strong> using a biodegradable product. Over time, the growth breaks down and is washed away by the rain — leaving your roof cleaner and safer.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to work?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Roof treatments aren’t instant — it usually takes <strong>6 to 12 months</strong> for the growth to fully break down. But the results are long-lasting and much gentler on your roof than water blasting.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What products do you use?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We use <strong>BioShield, a proven NZ-made treatment</strong> that’s safe for most roofing materials and won’t harm your garden when applied properly.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will it damage my plants or garden?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We <strong>pre-soak surrounding plants and rinse them again afterward</strong>. We’re careful and experienced — your hedges won’t suffer.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be home for the treatment?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <strong>Nope!</strong> As long as we’ve got access and a working hose tap, we’re good to go. We’ll send you a message when it’s done.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
