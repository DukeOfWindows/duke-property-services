    question: "What kind of decks can you clean?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We clean all sorts — <strong>pine, kwila, composite, hardwoods, and even painted or stained decks</strong>. We adjust our pressure and method depending on the surface.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Will it strip my stain or paint?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Not if we can help it. We use a <strong>low-to-medium pressure setting</strong> and work with the grain to avoid damage. If the stain is already flaking, it may come up — we’ll let you know before we start.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is it slippery afterward?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Nope — it’s the opposite! <strong>We remove slippery mould, grime, and algae</strong> that can make decks hazardous in winter. You’ll get better grip and a safer outdoor space.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do you treat mould or just wash it off?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Both. We apply a <strong>deck-safe mould treatment first</strong>, then rinse it clean. This helps keep your deck looking good for longer and slows regrowth.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I can use the deck again?",
    answer: (
      <>
        It’ll be dry in a few hours, depending on the weather — but <strong>you can walk on it as soon as we’re done</strong>. Just watch your step if it’s still damp.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
  question: "What are your payment terms?",
  answer: (
    <>
      The job is <strong>invoiced and payment is due upon completion</strong>. You can pay by <strong>bank transfer, EFTPOS, or cash</strong> — whichever works best for you.
    </>
  ),
